        <h3>Why do I have a Profile and an About page?</h3>
        <p>This page is for the non-academic part of me.</p>
        
        <h3>What makes me different?</h3>
        <p>
          I was born with a defect that after meeting a person or even knowing a person a fairly long time, I can't perfectly reconstruct their face. But I can still recognize them in a crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
          This structural difference enables me to appreciate the beauty of blurriness. By blurriness, I mean I get to awe at something without digging into the details.
        </p>
        <p>
          For engineers, the beauty originates from the understanding of the minutiae, the enlightenment that happens when the details are revealed. But for me, the beauty can also lie in the fact of not revealing the details—just letting the incredible engineering work stay there so I get to appreciate it all day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, I'm more interested in architectural designs and systems, and able to generate unique perspectives towards architectures.
