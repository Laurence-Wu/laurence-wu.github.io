## My feelings to this project

This is like buiding a child of my own. Every feature properly tested to integrated, and all those annoying configuration on the google cloud. This is my first serious startup project.

## Introduction

We all know how frustrating translating documents can be, especially complex PDFs. You lose your formatting, the context gets mixed up, and you spend hours fixing everything manually. Seek Hub is our solution: a smart, AI-powered platform designed to make the entire process effortless and deliver a perfect translation every time.

## Why We're Building This and What It Does

We started this project because we saw a clear need for a simpler, more reliable translation tool. In a world of powerful AI agents, the process of translating a document should be easy. Our goal is to handle all the complex and tedious work for you, so you can get a high-quality translation without the headache.

Here’s how simple we’ve made it:

1. You start by uploading your PDF document.
2. Our AI agent immediately gets to work, automatically translating the entire file. The most important part is that it **perfectly preserves the original layout and formatting**—no more broken tables or misplaced images.
3. In just a few moments, you’re presented with a ready-to-use, fully translated document.

The AI is smart enough to understand the document's context, but if you want to make a quick change, you can easily review the translation and accept smart suggestions for alternative wording. The goal is that you receive a document that is 99% of the way there, or completely finished, without you having to do any of the heavy lifting.

## The Technical Details

The convenience you experience on the frontend is made possible by some serious engineering on the backend.

- **Architecture:** We use a modern stack with a **Next.js** frontend and a **Python** backend. Our database is a NoSQL solution, currently **Firebase**, for smooth and reliable file uploads.
- **The Core Engine:** Our platform's real power comes from our custom-built backend pipeline.
  1. **Format Preservation Engine:** When you upload a PDF, our proprietary **PDF-to-Docs engine** is the first thing it touches. Its single most important job is to map out your document's structure. This allows us to reassemble the translated document perfectly, so you don't waste any time rebuilding tables, realigning images, or fixing layouts.
  2. **High-Speed Translation:** To deliver your translation quickly, our backend uses a sophisticated **asynchronous pipeline**. This system breaks down large documents and processes them in parallel using a **connection pool** and a **thread pool**. All this complexity is handled completely behind the scenes. For you, it just means you get your translated file back incredibly fast, even if it's a very large document.
  3. **Automatic Reassembly:** Once the translation is complete, our system automatically rebuilds the PDF, delivering a final product that looks just like your original.

## Project Summary

To put it simply, **Seek Hub is designed to make high-quality document translation effortless.** It removes the biggest headaches from the process: losing your formatting and doing tedious manual work. Our platform's core promise is to deliver a perfectly formatted, accurately translated PDF back to you in a fraction of the time it would normally take. By leveraging a powerful AI agent and a smart backend pipeline, we've created a tool that just works, letting you focus on your content, not the complex process of translation.
