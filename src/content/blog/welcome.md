# Welcome to My New Website!

I'm excited to share my new personal website built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). This modern static site generator allows me to create fast, content-focused websites while maintaining the flexibility to use my favorite frontend frameworks when needed.

## Why Astro?

After using React and Flask for my previous website, I decided to switch to Astro for several compelling reasons:

### Performance First
Astro ships zero JavaScript by default, which means lightning-fast page loads. When I do need interactivity, I can add it selectively using "islands" of JavaScript.

### Content Collections
The built-in content management system makes it easy to organize and manage blog posts and project documentation using Markdown files with type-safe frontmatter.

### Developer Experience
Hot reloading, excellent TypeScript support, and a great developer experience make building and maintaining the site a pleasure.

## What's New

This redesigned website includes:

- **Improved Blog**: Better organization with tags and categories
- **Project Showcase**: Detailed project pages with technology highlights  
- **Mathematical Content**: Integrated KaTeX support for technical writing
- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive design that works on all devices
- **Fast Performance**: Static generation for optimal loading speeds

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to continue sharing my thoughts on technology, engineering projects, and other interests through this new platform. The improved structure will make it easier to organize content and add new features as needed.

Stay tuned for more content, and feel free to explore the [projects section](/projects/) to see what I've been working on!
