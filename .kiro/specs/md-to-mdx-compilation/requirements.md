# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a compilation process that automatically transforms Markdown (.md) files to MDX (.mdx) files and renders them properly. This will allow users to write content in standard Markdown format while still benefiting from MDX's component integration capabilities, particularly for mermaid diagrams and other interactive elements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to write blog posts in standard Markdown format (.md), so that I can use familiar Markdown syntax without worrying about MDX-specific syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a .md file in the content directory THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and process it
2. WHEN the system processes a .md file THEN it SHALL convert mermaid code blocks to proper MDX component syntax
3. WHEN the system processes a .md file THEN it SHALL preserve all standard Markdown formatting and content
4. IF a .md file contains frontmatter THEN the system SHALL preserve it in the converted .mdx file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the compilation process to be automatic and seamless, so that I don't need to manually convert files or run additional build steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL automatically detect all .md files in the content directory
2. WHEN a .md file is detected THEN the system SHALL compile it to .mdx format before Astro processes it
3. WHEN the compilation is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure the .mdx file is properly formatted for Astro's content collection
4. IF compilation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what went wrong

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want mermaid diagrams in my .md files to render properly as interactive components, so that readers can interact with the diagrams using zoom and fullscreen features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a .md file contains ```mermaid code blocks THEN the system SHALL convert them to <Mermaid> component syntax
2. WHEN the mermaid conversion occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve the diagram code exactly as written
3. WHEN the converted .mdx file is rendered THEN mermaid diagrams SHALL display with interactive controls
4. WHEN users interact with mermaid diagrams THEN they SHALL have access to zoom, reset, and fullscreen functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the compilation process to handle file watching and hot reloading, so that changes to .md files are immediately reflected during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL watch for changes to .md files
2. WHEN a .md file is modified THEN the system SHALL automatically recompile it to .mdx
3. WHEN recompilation occurs THEN the browser SHALL hot reload to show the updated content
4. IF recompilation fails THEN the system SHALL display error information in the browser console

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to handle both existing .mdx files and new .md files, so that I can gradually migrate content or use both formats as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both .md and .mdx files exist in the content directory THEN the system SHALL process both types correctly
2. WHEN a .mdx file already exists THEN the system SHALL not overwrite it with compiled .md content
3. WHEN processing mixed content types THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent routing and URL structure
4. IF there are naming conflicts THEN the system SHALL prioritize .mdx files over compiled .md files

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the compilation process to be configurable, so that I can customize how different Markdown elements are transformed to MDX components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the compilation process THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for component mappings
2. WHEN custom component mappings are defined THEN the system SHALL use them during compilation
3. WHEN no custom mappings are provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults
4. IF invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL fall back to defaults and log warnings

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to write mathematical expressions using LaTeX syntax in my .md files, so that complex formulas render beautifully like in Typora.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a .md file contains inline math expressions (`$...$`) THEN the system SHALL convert them to proper MDX format for KaTeX rendering
2. WHEN a .md file contains display math blocks (`$$...$$`) THEN the system SHALL convert them to centered display equations
3. WHEN math expressions are processed THEN the system SHALL preserve LaTeX syntax and special characters
4. IF math expressions contain errors THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages during compilation
5. WHEN rendered pages load THEN math expressions SHALL display with proper typography and formatting

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want all standard Markdown elements in my .md files to be preserved exactly as written, so that my content renders correctly without any unexpected changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a .md file contains headers (# ## ### etc.) THEN the system SHALL preserve them exactly in the .mdx output
2. WHEN a .md file contains lists (ordered and unordered) THEN the system SHALL preserve their structure and formatting
3. WHEN a .md file contains links, images, emphasis (bold/italic), and inline code THEN the system SHALL preserve them unchanged
4. WHEN a .md file contains blockquotes, horizontal rules, and line breaks THEN the system SHALL maintain their formatting
5. WHEN a .md file contains regular code blocks (non-mermaid) THEN the system SHALL preserve them as standard code blocks
6. IF a .md file mixes standard Markdown with special elements THEN the system SHALL only transform the special elements

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want tables in my .md files to render with enhanced styling, so that data is presented clearly and professionally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a .md file contains Markdown tables THEN the system SHALL preserve table structure during compilation
2. WHEN tables are rendered THEN they SHALL use the enhanced table styling with borders and hover effects
3. WHEN tables are displayed on mobile devices THEN they SHALL be responsive and readable
4. IF tables contain special formatting THEN the system SHALL preserve code blocks, links, and emphasis within cells
