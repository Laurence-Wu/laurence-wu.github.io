# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Astro build is failing because the `astro.config.mjs` file is trying to import a complex MD to MDX plugin system (`./src/build/md-to-mdx-plugin.js`) that has missing dependencies or broken imports. The build error indicates that Vite cannot properly evaluate the SSR module due to import resolution issues. We need to fix the build by either completing the missing dependencies or removing/simplifying the problematic plugin system to get the site building successfully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Astro build to complete successfully, so that I can deploy my website without build errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run build` THEN the build SHALL complete without import resolution errors
2. WHEN the build completes THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved
3. IF the MD to MDX plugin system is incomplete THEN it SHALL be removed or simplified to prevent build failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain existing Markdown and MDX processing capabilities, so that my blog content renders correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing Markdown files THEN existing remark and rehype plugins SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN rendering blog posts THEN Mermaid diagrams SHALL render correctly
3. WHEN processing content THEN math expressions SHALL render with KaTeX
4. WHEN building the site THEN all existing Typora-compatible features SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and maintainable Astro configuration, so that future modifications are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the astro.config.mjs THEN it SHALL only include working and necessary plugins
2. WHEN the configuration is loaded THEN there SHALL be no unused or broken imports
3. IF custom plugins are included THEN they SHALL have all required dependencies available
